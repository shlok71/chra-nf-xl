# CHRA-NF-XL Development Phases

This document outlines the 7-phase development plan for the CHRA-NF-XL project.

### Phase 1: Bootstrapping & Core Infrastructure (Complete)
- **Objective:** Establish the monorepo, cross-platform build system, and CI/CD pipeline.
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - GitHub monorepo with a unified directory structure.
  - Root `CMakeLists.txt` for C++ components.
  - `tools/bootstrap.sh` for Linux/macOS and `tools/bootstrap.ps1` for Windows.
  - Docker environment for reproducible builds.
  - GitHub Actions CI to verify builds on all three major OSes.

### Phase 2: BHV & SHM Implementation
- **Objective:** Develop and test the core binary embedding and associative memory libraries.
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - C++ implementation of the Binary Hash Vector (BHV) generator.
  - C++ implementation of the Sparse Hashed Memory (SHM) system.
  - Python bindings for both libraries.
  - Comprehensive unit and integration tests.

### Phase 3: Spiking Gated Router & EDGT-XL Transformer
- **Objective:** Implement the sparse MoE transformer architecture.
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Spiking Gated Router module for expert selection.
  - EDGT-XL transformer layers with 2-bit quantization and N:M sparsity.
  - Recurrent KV cache with Bloom-sketch compression.
  - Inference pipeline for text generation.

### Phase 4: Multimodal Primitives (NCA & DNR)
- **Objective:** Build the components for visual data processing.
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) canvas for OCR and drawing.
  - Differentiable Neural Renderer (DNR) for vector-to-raster conversion.
  - Integration with the core embedding and memory systems.

### Phase 5: Specialized Experts
- **Objective:** Develop high-level experts for advanced tasks.
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - **Task Orchestration Expert:** Manages complex, multi-step workflows.
  - **Tool Invocation Expert:** Interfaces with external APIs and tools (e.g., file system, browser).
  - **Episodic Memory Expert:** Enables retrieval from ultra-long-term context.
  - **GUI Manager Expert:** Controls the multi-canvas user interface.

### Phase 6: Full Model Integration & Optimization
- **Objective:** Assemble all components into a single, cohesive model and optimize for performance.
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - End-to-end integrated model.
  - Fine-tuning of quantization, sparsity, and low-rank decomposition parameters.
  - Performance profiling and optimization to meet speed and memory targets.

### Phase 7: Application Layer & Deployment
- **Objective:** Build user-facing applications and package the model for deployment.
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Example applications demonstrating model capabilities.
  - Packaged releases for major platforms.
  - Comprehensive documentation for developers and end-users.
